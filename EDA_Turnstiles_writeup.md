 # Abstract
  Several of New York subway stations are considered to be some of the busiest stations in the world. Cleaning these kinds of stations during busy times could result in multiple issues.  Finding the perfect time for cleaning is the objective of the data analysis. The data that is used in the study analysis is taken from Metropolitan Transportation Authority(MTA) website
